      Welcome to <strong>Sin City by Night</strong>, your comprehensive digital
      toolkit for exploring the World of Darkness in America's most decadent
      city. In the shadows between the casino lights and desert darkness,
      ancient Kindred play games of power that would make mortal billionaires
      weep.

        "What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas" takes on a whole new meaning when
        you're dealing with centuries-old vampires, blood-soaked casino empires,
        and territorial wars fought in penthouse suites and underground tunnels
        beneath the Strip.

    <h3 class="content__heading">About This Setting</h3>

    <h4 class="content__subheading">The Vegas Domain</h4>
    <p class="content__body">
      Las Vegas represents one of the most unique Camarilla domains in North
      America. Built on excess, greed, and the constant flow of mortal tourists,
      it provides an endless feeding ground for the Kindred who have claimed it.
      The city's 24/7 nature, transient population, and culture of hedonism make
      it the perfect hunting ground—and the perfect place for ancient grudges to
      play out under neon lights.
    </p>

    <h4 class="content__subheading">Power Structures & Politics</h4>
    <p class="content__body">
      The Kindred of Las Vegas don't just feed on tourists—they <em>own</em> the
      infrastructure that brings them here. From the massive casino complexes to
      the entertainment venues, vampire elders pull strings that determine the
      fate of millions of visitors. But beneath the glittering facade, the same
      ancient conflicts that have plagued Kindred society for millennia continue
      to simmer.
